            - **Glossary Utilization Rate:**  
             (Number of glossary terms with both source count > 0 and target count > 0) / (Total glossary terms) × 100  
             The percentage of glossary entries for which the source term appears at least once in the source document and the corresponding translated term also appears at least once in the target document. This KPI measures how effectively the glossary terms are being applied in the translation when they are present in the source text. In other words, it reflects the proportion of glossary terms used in the source text that have been correctly utilized in the translation, indicating adherence to the glossary during the translation process.

            - **Glossary Translation Coverage Rate:**  
             (Number of glossary terms with both source count > 0 and target count > 0) / (Number of glossary terms with source count > 0) × 100  
             The percentage of glossary terms that appear in the source document and whose approved translations also appear in the target document, regardless of how many times they occur. This KPI measures the extent to which glossary terms present in the source text are covered by their translations in the target text. In other words, it shows how comprehensively the glossary terms from the source are represented in the translation, indicating the coverage of glossary terms in the translated content.

            - **Total Count Discrepancy:**  
              The absolute difference between the total occurrences of all source terms and the total occurrences of all translated terms in the target document.

            - **Total Source Terms Count:**  
              The total number of occurrences of all glossary terms in the source document.

            - **Total Translated Terms Count:**  
              The total number of occurrences of all translated glossary terms in the target document.

            - **Sum of Term Frequency Mismatch Rates:**  
              The total sum of the relative differences in term frequencies between the source and target texts across all glossary terms.

            - **Average Term Frequency Mismatch Rate:**  
              The average relative difference in term frequencies per glossary term, measures how much, on average, the frequency of glossary terms in the translation deviates from the source.
                A value of 0 means perfect frequency match; between 0 and 1 indicates moderate variation; above 1 signals significant overuse or underuse.
                High values may reveal inconsistencies, omissions, or stylistic differences affecting translation quality.
            - **Number of Source Terms with Count > 0:**  
              The count of glossary terms that appear at least once in the source document.

            - **Number of Target Terms with Count > 0:**  
              The count of glossary terms that appear at least once in the target document.

            - **Number of Terms with Both Source and Target Count > 0:**  
              The count of glossary terms that appear at least once in both the source and target documents.
